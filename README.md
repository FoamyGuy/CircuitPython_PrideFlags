### Pride Flags drawn with CircuitPython DisplayIO

This repo serves two primary purposes: 

- In celebration and support of Pride month, and the LGBT community generally.
- To provide several circuitpython displayio examples that illustrate different ways to achieve rendering graphics.

### Additional contributions are welcome!

If you'd like to submit examples of different flags, or different techniques to draw them, please open a PR.
